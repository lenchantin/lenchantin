- 👋 Hi, I’m @lenchantin (Dustin, He/Him, 40)
- 👀 I’m interested in creating custom SaaS apps that start small, with one client, and grow to benefit other clients. I am also a full-stack web developer with 5 years experience in Craft, Twig, GraphQL, and Vue.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Django, AWS, Laravel 8, Vue 3, Inertia, and Adonis.
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to colaborate. Unfortunately, I'm a bit busy at present. Maybe in the future. :)
