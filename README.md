- 👋 Hi, I’m @lenchantin (Jack, He/Him, a Jackalope, 40's)
- 👀 I’m interested in creating custom SaaS apps that start small, with one client, and grow to benefit other clients. I am also a full-stack web developer, doing web design since 1996 (when the internet still had that 'new car' smell), with 5 years experience in Craft, Expression Engine, Twig, GraphQL, and Vue. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, PHP, JS, Django, AWS, Laravel 8, Vue 3, Inertia, and Adonis.
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to colaborate. Unfortunately, I'm a bit busy at present. Maybe in the future. :)
